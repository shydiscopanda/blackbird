PJS-type hamartomatous polyps are most common in the small intestine (in order of prevalence: jejunum, ileum, and duodenum) but can also occur in the stomach, large bowel, and extraintestinal sites including the renal pelvis, bronchus, gall bladder, nasal passages, urinary bladder, and ureters. GI polyps can result in chronic bleeding, anemia, and recurrent obstruction and intussusception requiring repeated laparotomy and bowel resection. Mucocutaneous hyperpigmentation presents in childhood as dark blue to dark brown macules around the mouth, eyes, and nostrils, in the perianal area, and on the buccal mucosa. Hyperpigmented macules on the fingers are common. The macules may fade in puberty and adulthood. Recognition of the distinctive skin manifestations is important especially in individuals who have PJS as the result of a <i>de novo</i> pathogenic variant as these skin findings often predate GI signs and symptoms. Individuals with PJS are at increased risk for a wide variety of epithelial malignancies (colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, breast, and ovarian cancers). Females are at risk for sex cord tumors with annular tubules (SCTAT), a benign neoplasm of the ovaries, and adenoma malignum of the cervix, a rare aggressive cancer. Males occasionally develop large calcifying Sertoli cell tumors of the testes, which secrete estrogen and can lead to gynecomastia, advanced skeletal age, and ultimately short stature, if untreated.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DIAGNOSIS/TESTING">The diagnosis of PJS is based on clinical findings. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in <i>STK11</i> by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis and allows for testing of at-risk relatives.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MANAGEMENT"><i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Routine endoscopic surveillance with polypectomy decreases the frequency of emergency laparotomy and bowel loss resulting from intussusception. Small-bowel imaging includes video capsule endoscopy (VCE), CT enterography, and/or magnetic resonance enterography (MRE). Balloon-assisted enteroscopy allows for removal of deep small-bowel polyps. Occasionally intraoperative enteroscopy and enterotomy is needed for removal of large distal small-bowel polyps. Intussusception and malignancies should be treated in the standard manner. <i>Prevention of primary manifestations:</i> Although not specifically studied in individuals with PJS, prophylactic mastectomy to decrease the risk of breast cancer could be considered based on family history or other clinical factors. Similarly, there is no prospective data on gynecologic prophylactic surgery for the elevated gynecologic cancer risk in females with PJS. <i>Surveillance:</i> In children and adolescents: colonoscopy and upper endoscopy at age eight years; if negative, follow up at age 18 years. If polyps are detected repeat every one to three years based on size, number, and histopathology of polyps. Small-bowel surveillance by MRE or VCE every one to three years beginning at age eight years. Examination for precocious puberty in females annually beginning at age eight years. Testicular examination and examination for feminizing changes in males annually beginning at age ten years. In adults: Colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small-bowel examination by MRE or VCE every two to three years beginning at age 18 years; clinical breast examination in women every six months beginning at age 30 years; mammogram and breast MRI in women annually beginning at age 30 years; pelvic examination and pap smear in women annually beginning at age 18 to 20 years. Pancreatic imaging with endoscopic ultrasound or MRI/MRCP annually beginning at age 30 to 35 years. <i>Evaluation of relatives at risk:</i> If the pathogenic variant in the family is known, offer molecular genetic testing to at-risk relatives so that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early diagnosis and prevention of disease through appropriate surveillance and consideration of prophylactic measures in affected family members. If the family variant is not known, offer clinical diagnostic evaluations to all at-risk family members, who will benefit from early treatment and appropriate surveillance.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="GENETIC COUNSELING">PJS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of individuals diagnosed with PJS have an affected parent; however, many individuals with PJS represent apparently simplex cases. The exact proportion of individuals who have PJS as the result of a <i>de novo</i> pathogenic variant is unknown. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the <i>STK11</i> pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the <i>STK11</i> pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, predictive testing for at-risk family members, prenatal testing, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.

Heart disease as defined for this Statistical Brief includes coronary artery disease, angina, heart attacks, dysrhythmias, and heart failure. For more than two decades, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Household Component (MEPS-HC) has been a major data source for national estimates of healthcare expenses for the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population. This Statistical Brief presents estimates for healthcare expenditures for the treatment of heart disease by selected characteristics among adults based on the 2017 MEPS-HC. All analyses use MEPS full-year person-level sampling weights, which take disproportionate sampling and survey nonresponse into account. Only differences between estimates that are statistically significant at the 0.05 level are mentioned in the text of this Statistical Brief.</AbstractText></Abstract><Sections><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.fm.s1">Highlights</SectionTitle></Section><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.s1">Introduction</SectionTitle></Section><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.s2">Findings</SectionTitle></Section><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.s3">Data Source</SectionTitle></Section><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.s4">Definitions</SectionTitle></Section><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.s5">About MEPS</SectionTitle></Section><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.rl.r1">References</SectionTitle></Section><Section><SectionTitle book="mepssb" part="stat531" sec="stat531.s6">Suggested Citation</SectionTitle></Section></Sections><ContributionDate><Year>2020</Year><Month>07</Month></ContributionDate></BookDocument><PubmedBookData><History><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="pubmed"><Year>2022</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>1</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="medline"><Year>2022</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>1</Minute></PubMedPubDate><PubMedPubDate PubStatus="entrez"><Year>2022</Year><Month>6</Month><Day>14</Day><Hour>6</Hour><Minute>1</Minute></PubMedPubDate></History><PublicationStatus>ppublish</PublicationStatus><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="pubmed">35696502</ArticleId></ArticleIdList></PubmedBookData></PubmedBookArticle><PubmedBookArticle><BookDocument><PMID Version="1">20301510</PMID><ArticleIdList><ArticleId IdType="bookaccession">NBK1335</ArticleId></ArticleIdList><Book><Publisher><PublisherName>University of Washington, Seattle</PublisherName><PublisherLocation>Seattle (WA)</PublisherLocation></Publisher><BookTitle book="gene">GeneReviews<sup>®</sup></BookTitle><PubDate><Year>1993</Year></PubDate><BeginningDate><Year>1993</Year></BeginningDate><EndingDate><Year>2022</Year></EndingDate><AuthorList Type="editors"><Author><LastName>Adam</LastName><ForeName>Margaret P</ForeName><Initials>MP</Initials></Author><Author><LastName>Everman</LastName><ForeName>David B</ForeName><Initials>DB</Initials></Author><Author><LastName>Mirzaa</LastName><ForeName>Ghayda M</ForeName><Initials>GM</Initials></Author><Author><LastName>Pagon</LastName><ForeName>Roberta A</ForeName><Initials>RA</Initials></Author><Author><LastName>Wallace</LastName><ForeName>Stephanie E</ForeName><Initials>SE</Initials></Author><Author><LastName>Bean</LastName><ForeName>Lora JH</ForeName><Initials>LJH</Initials></Author><Author><LastName>Gripp</LastName><ForeName>Karen W</ForeName><Initials>KW</Initials></Author><Author><LastName>Amemiya</LastName><ForeName>Anne</ForeName><Initials>A</Initials></Author></AuthorList><Medium>Internet</Medium></Book><ArticleTitle book="gene" part="marfan"><i>FBN1</i>-Related Marfan Syndrome</ArticleTitle><Language>eng</Language><AuthorList Type="authors"><Author><LastName>Dietz</LastName><ForeName>Harry</ForeName><Initials>H</Initials><AffiliationInfo><Affiliation>Victor A McKusick Professor, Departments of Genetic Medicine, Pediatrics, Medicine, and Molecular Biology &amp; Genetics;

Cardinal manifestations involve the ocular, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Ocular findings include myopia (&gt;50% of affected individuals); ectopia lentis (seen in approximately 60% of affected individuals); and an increased risk for retinal detachment, glaucoma, and early cataracts. Skeletal system manifestations include bone overgrowth and joint laxity; disproportionately long extremities for the size of the trunk (dolichostenomelia); overgrowth of the ribs that can push the sternum in (pectus excavatum) or out (pectus carinatum); and scoliosis that ranges from mild to severe and progressive. The major morbidity and early mortality in Marfan syndrome relate to the cardiovascular system and include dilatation of the aorta at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva (predisposing to aortic tear and rupture), mitral valve prolapse with or without regurgitation, tricuspid valve prolapse, and enlargement of the proximal pulmonary artery. Severe and prolonged regurgitation of the mitral and/or aortic valve can predispose to left ventricular dysfunction and occasionally heart failure. With proper management, the life expectancy of someone with Marfan syndrome approximates that of the general population.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="DIAGNOSIS/TESTING">The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is established in a proband (by definition a person without a known family history of Marfan syndrome) who has an <i>FBN1</i> pathogenic variant known to be associated with Marfan syndrome and EITHER of the following: Aortic root enlargement (Z-score ≥2.0). Ectopia lentis.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="MANAGEMENT"><i>Treatment of manifestations:</i> Comprehensive management by a multidisciplinary team including a clinical geneticist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedist, and cardiothoracic surgeon is strongly recommended. Treatment typically includes spectacle correction for refractive errors and, sometimes, surgical removal of a dislocated lens with artificial lens implantation (preferably after growth is complete). Glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment are treated in the standard fashion per an ophthalmologist. Scoliosis may require bracing or surgical stabilization; repair of pectus deformity is largely cosmetic. Functional deficits or pain associated with protusio acetabulae may respond to physical therapy, analgesics, or anti-inflammatory medications. Orthotics and arch supports can lessen leg fatigue, joint pain, and muscle cramps associated with pes planus. Dental crowding may be addressed through orthodontia and a palatal expander may be considered in some cases. Surgical repair of the aorta is indicated either when the maximal measurement of the aortic root approaches 5.0 cm in adults or older children, when the rate of increase of the aortic root diameter approaches 0.5-1.0 cm per year, or if there is progressive and severe aortic regurgitation. For younger children, aortic root surgery should be considered once: (1) the rate of increase of the aortic root diameter approaches 0.5-1.0 cm per year, or (2) there is progressive and severe aortic regurgitation. Severe and progressive mitral valve regurgitation with attendant ventricular dysfunction requires immediate attention of a cardiologist or cardiothoracic surgeon and is the leading indication for cardiovascular surgery in children with Marfan syndrome. Afterload-reducing agents can improve cardiovascular function when congestive heart failure is present. Standard treatment for hernias and pneumothorax is recommended. There are no known effective therapies for symptomatic dural ectasia. <i>Prevention of primary manifestations:</i> Medications that reduce hemodynamic stress on the aortic wall, such as beta blockers (β blockers) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are routinely prescribed. This therapy should be managed by a cardiologist or clinical geneticist familiar with its use. Therapy is generally initiated at the time of diagnosis with Marfan syndrome at any age or upon appreciation of progressive aortic root dilatation even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis. <i>Surveillance:</i> Measurement of length/height/weight at each visit. Ophthalmologic examination annually or as clinically indicated. Clinical assessment for chest wall deformities and scoliosis at each visit until skeletal maturity, although severe scoliosis may require ongoing surveillance in adulthood. At least annual dental evaluation, including orthodontia, as indicated. Echocardiography annually when aortic dimensions are small and the rate of aortic dilation is slow; more frequent than annual examinations are indicated when the aortic root diameter exceeds approximately 4.5 cm in adults, rates of aortic dilation exceed approximately 0.3 cm per year, or significant aortic regurgitation is present. Intermittent surveillance of the entire aorta with CT or MRA scans beginning in young adulthood or at least annually in anyone with a history of aortic root replacement or dissection. <i>Agents</i>/<i>circumstances to avoid:</i> Contact sports, competitive sports, and isometric exercise; activities that cause joint injury or pain; agents that stimulate the cardiovascular system, including decongestants and excessive caffeine; agents that cause vasoconstriction, including triptans; LASIK correction of refractive errors; breathing against resistance or positive pressure ventilation in those with a documented predisposition for pneumothorax; fluoroquinolone antibiotics, which may exacerbate the predisposition for aneurysm and dissection; classes of antihypertensive agents (e.g., calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors) where there is an absence of direct evidence for their efficacy or safety in individuals with Marfan syndrome. <i>Evaluation of relatives at risk:</i> It is recommended that the genetic status of at-risk relatives of any age be clarified so that affected individuals can undergo routine surveillance for early detection of medically significant complications, particularly potentially life-threatening cardiac manifestations. Genetic status of at-risk relatives can be established EITHER: By molecular genetic testing if the <i>FBN1</i> pathogenic variant in the family is known; OR In those with a rigorously defined family history of Marfan syndrome, by the presence of ONE OR MORE of the following: Ectopia lentis. A systemic score ≥7. Aortic root dilatation (Z-score ≥2.0 for individuals age ≥20 years or Z-score ≥3.0 for those age &lt;20 years). <i>Pregnancy management:</i> An individual with Marfan syndrome should consider pregnancy only after appropriate counseling from a clinical geneticist or cardiologist familiar with this condition, a genetic counselor, and a high-risk obstetrician because of the risk of more rapid dilation of the aorta or aortic dissection during pregnancy, delivery, or in the immediate postpartum period. Cardiovascular imaging with echocardiography should be performed every two to three months during pregnancy to monitor aortic root size and growth. Monitoring should continue in the immediate postpartum period because of the increased risk for aortic dissection. Individuals with Marfan syndrome who anticipate pregnancy or become pregnant should continue use of β blockers; however, some other classes of medications such as ARBs should be discontinued because of the increased risk for fetal loss, oligohydramnios, and abnormal development, often related to second- and third-trimester exposure.</AbstractText><AbstractText Label="GENETIC COUNSELING">Marfan syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 75% of individuals with Marfan syndrome have an affected parent; approximately 25% have a <i>de novo</i>

Once the <i>FBN1</i> pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.</AbstractText><CopyrightInformation>Copyright © 1993-2022, University of Washington, Seattle.
